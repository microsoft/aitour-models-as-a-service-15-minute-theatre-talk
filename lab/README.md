## Pre-Requisites

To participate in this workshop, you will need:

1. Your own laptop.
   * It need only be capable of running a browser and GitHub Codespaces, so almost any laptop will do.
   * A recent version of Edge, Chrome or Safari is recommended.
2. Familiarity with Visual Studio Code.
   * We'll be using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as our development environment.
   * If you're not familiar with VS Code, you can find it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
3. Familiarity with Python.
   * We'll be using Python as our programming language.
   * If you're not familiar with Python, you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/).

## Get Started

To get started you will need to follow the instructions in the Skillable environment. When you have authenticated into the Skillable environment, launch the Edge browser from the desktop. It's pinned to the taskbar. By default the browser will open with three tabs. The first tab is the lab manual, the second tab is the AI Foundry, the third is the Azure portal.

Follow the instructions in that file to continue.
