## Slides

<!-- The [Presentation slides](https://aka.ms/AArxx4v) has incomplete presenter notes. Please use the [Presenter Script](SCRIPT.md) as a guide on what to say for each slide instead.  -->

<!-- You can also watch a video walk through of the PPT slides with the script being read [here](https://aka.ms/AAs4l8x).  -->

### Presenting the slides

- As attendees enter the room have `slide 2` up on the screen. (Preferably add Wi-Fi information to this slide.)

- Once everyone is seated jump to `slide 5`, which is the 'Meet the Instructor and Proctors" slide. For the sake of time this is the slide you must begin with. Please **edit this slide** with relevant information including:

  - Lead instructor name and picture
  - Proctor names and pictures
  - Wi-Fi information
  - Link to to launch Participant Lab Environment (provided by Skillable team)

- Let the attendees connect to the Wi-Fi and instruct them to navigate to the skillable link and press the `Launch` button. Launching the lab may take some time so start the presentation once the majority of participants have clicked the launch button.

<!-- - Slide 10 is the slide that says "DEMO". Once you get to this slide share your screen and: -->
<!--
1. Play the [Contoso Creative Writer App demo video](https://aka.ms/AAs4t0n). You could also deploy the application on your own screen and show that instead.  -->

1. Switch to the Skillable Lab Manual page and complete each step of the instructions with the attendees. They should be carrying out the steps on their own machines at the same time.

<!-- 3. You can watch a video walk through of this process here:  [Contoso Creative Writer - Skillable lab manual walk through - video](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:v:/t/AI-Tour-FY25/EWW5434JuPpMlP9O5XPsFV8Bqdz6a2LOk08xyJYqFEbBnA?e=of8G3N).  -->

### Launching the lab environment

When this lab is delivered during AI Tour, the [Skillable](https://docs.skillable.com/) platform provides a temporary Azure account for each participant to use. After logging in, the environment provides a set of Lab Instructions, the launching point for the lab content.

Depending on your role in the workshop, you will launch the Skillable lab environment using a dedicated link.

  - You must log in using your Microsoft corporate credentials to access this link. **Note**: the lab environment will appear in 2-3 minutes,
  - You'll need to wait up to 10 minutes more for Azure resources to deploy to the temporary Azure account
  before running the workshop.
  - Log into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using the credentials in the Lab Instructions to monitor progress. In the
  - single resource group created, you 14 Azure resource when the 34 deployments are complete.
- **Presenters and Proctors**: Launch Lab WRK552 from the Tech Check portal. (This link will be provided by your content owner 1-2
  weeks before lab events.) Use this link to test the lab using an environment identical to that provided to lab participants.
